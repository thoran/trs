# 0.9.1

# Changes since 0.8:
# 1. - BasicInstructionSet and rolled the contents into ToyRobot rather than including them from a module.
# 0/1
# 2. - tabletop_dimensions are no longer settable, though they still exist internally to the Tabletop class.

require 'switches'

switches = Switches.new do |s|
  s.set(:p, :program) # The name of the program to run as it is in the filesystem.
  s.set(:d, :directory, :programs_directory) # The directory where programs can be found.
end
