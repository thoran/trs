* I'd previously mixed in the command methods into the ToyRobot class, then I tried to
  simplify it and placed them directly in the ToyRobot class, but now that might mean
  doing so with the CommandParser class.
* Make the composed CommandParser in ToyRobot injectable, either via a mixin or
  a composed class or classes.
* Split out the input parsing stuff from the ToyRobotSimulator class.
* Write a few more tests, particulary moving those which are in ToyRobot to CommandParser.
* Remove the 2 dimensional array from Tabletop and only use a single tuple in ToyRobot.
* Create a branch with a super simple version.
* Finish the complex commands branch.
* Enable dynamically loadable commands.
* The CommandParser class is polluted with robot commands methods and non-robot command
  methods, so separating those would be good.
* Consider making each command its own class.
* Consider adding a ToyRobot namespace.
